# normalizer
This application was written with Python (my version is 2.7.16 but this is compatible with python 3). Because the logic is contained in one file (normalizer.py) and I used only standard libraries (csv and sys), I did not include any additional folder structure or anything that needs to be bundled or installed. Running this program should be as simple as calling the file from the command line.

## Instructions:
- clone down the repo `git clone https://github.com/kaileighrose/normalizer.git`
- In your terminal, CD into the `normalizer` directory
- Run `python normalizer.py < input_filename > output_filename`
- You should then see the output.csv file that you can open to see the results
